# Snake Field
The objective of the game is to eat food and grow the length of the snake without running into walls or its own body. As the snake grows longer, it becomes more difficult to navigate around the board without running into obstacles. The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or its own body, at which point the player must start over.
